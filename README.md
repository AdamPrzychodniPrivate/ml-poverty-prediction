# ML-Poverty-Prediction

## Introduction
This repository houses the `ml-poverty-prediction` project, which focuses on the Prediction of Poverty and Malnutrition Prevalence with diffrent Machine Learning techniques. This project is based on the research paper ["Multivariate Random Forest Prediction of Poverty and Malnutrition Prevalence" (research paper)](http://barrett.dyson.cornell.edu/files/papers/Browne%20et%20al.%20Manuscript.pdf). However, our approach diverges by employing a variety of different Machine Learning (ML) techniques to potentially enhance prediction accuracy and model effectiveness.

Also, a synthesized version of the paper is available in the form of a research article, which can be accessed [here (research article)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0255519).

## Project Overview
### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a ML model that can accurately predict poverty and malnutrition prevalence, leveraging the data used in the aforementioned research but exploring different ML methodologies.

### Goals
- **Validation and Enhancement**: We aim to validate the findings of the original research and seek ways to enhance the accuracy of poverty and malnutrition predictions.
- **Model Comparison**: A key goal is to compare the effectiveness of various ML models in predicting poverty and malnutrition prevalence, thus contributing to the broader field of socio-economic predictive analytics.

## Data Utilization
(Here, you would detail the types of data used, how you plan to gather, process, and utilize this data. Be specific about data sources, preprocessing steps, and how this data will be split for training and testing purposes.)
